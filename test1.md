When rice becomes moldy or spoils, it can emit various **gases**, including:

### 🌫️ **1. Carbon Dioxide (CO₂)**  
- Mold and bacteria produce **carbon dioxide** during their metabolic processes.  
- A buildup of CO₂ in a sealed container can cause it to puff up or create a slight vacuum when opened.  

### 🦠 **2. Methane (CH₄)**  
- In anaerobic (low-oxygen) conditions, certain bacteria can generate **methane** gas.  
- This is more common in moist or fermented rice.  

### 💨 **3. Hydrogen Sulfide (H₂S)**  
- If rice rots due to sulfur-reducing bacteria, it may release **hydrogen sulfide**, which smells like rotten eggs.  
- This is rare but possible if the rice is exposed to sulfur-containing compounds.  

### ⚠️ **4. Mycotoxins (not gases but harmful compounds)**  
- Mold can produce **mycotoxins**, which are toxic chemicals rather than gases.  
- Though not directly detectable by smell, they are harmful if inhaled or ingested.  

✅ **Tip:** If rice smells sour, musty, or rotten, it’s best to discard it, as inhaling mold spores or consuming spoiled rice can be hazardous.
