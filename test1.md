When rice becomes moldy or spoils, it can emit various **gases**, including:

### üå´Ô∏è **1. Carbon Dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ)**  
- Mold and bacteria produce **carbon dioxide** during their metabolic processes.  
- A buildup of CO‚ÇÇ in a sealed container can cause it to puff up or create a slight vacuum when opened.  

### ü¶† **2. Methane (CH‚ÇÑ)**  
- In anaerobic (low-oxygen) conditions, certain bacteria can generate **methane** gas.  
- This is more common in moist or fermented rice.  

### üí® **3. Hydrogen Sulfide (H‚ÇÇS)**  
- If rice rots due to sulfur-reducing bacteria, it may release **hydrogen sulfide**, which smells like rotten eggs.  
- This is rare but possible if the rice is exposed to sulfur-containing compounds.  

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **4. Mycotoxins (not gases but harmful compounds)**  
- Mold can produce **mycotoxins**, which are toxic chemicals rather than gases.  
- Though not directly detectable by smell, they are harmful if inhaled or ingested.  

‚úÖ **Tip:** If rice smells sour, musty, or rotten, it‚Äôs best to discard it, as inhaling mold spores or consuming spoiled rice can be hazardous.

# Mycotxins
* Mold produce secondary metabolites (toxic chemical) that are toxic known as mycotoxins. 
* 50% of house have mold.
* Small as 0.1micron; mold spore are between 1 and 20 microns.
* Helping to prepare the substrate on which the molds exist for digestion.
* Act as defense mechanisms. 
* Produced when the organisms are under stress [i.e. competition/defense, or simply due to inhospitable environmental conditions].
* Not every species of a type of mold will produce mycotoxins.

* The most common and dangerous mycotoxin producing molds are:

    * Alternaria
    * Aspergillus
    * Chaetomium
    * Cladosporium
    * Fusarium
    * Myrothecium
    * Penicillium
    * Stachybotrys
    * Trichoderma
    * Thrichothecium

*  400 mycotoxins, most are cytotoxic (toxic to living cells); 6 specific mycotoxins which are considered the most dangerous to humans. 

### Aflatoxins (C <sub>17</sub>H<sub>16</sub>O<sub>6</sub>)
![Aflatoxins]( https://moldhelpforyou.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Aflatoxin-Mycotoxin.jpg)

* Produced by different species of Aspergillus, particularly Flavus, Oryzae, Fumigatus and Parasiticus
* The most common and harmful aflatoxins include:

    - Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) ‚Üí Most toxic and carcinogenic

    - Aflatoxin B2 (AFB2)

    - Aflatoxin G1 (AFG1)

    - Aflatoxin G2 (AFG2)

    - Aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) ‚Üí Found in milk from animals fed contaminated feed

* Present in the food chain. 
* Aflatoxins are mutagenic, carcinogenic, teratogenic and immunosuppressive.
* Aflatoxin B1 can cause mutations to both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA meaning they can cause mitochondrial damage.
* Aflatoxins cause aflatoxicosis which is characterized by liver damage in both humans and animals.
* Aflatoxins cause an increase in circulating alpha tumor necrosing factor, suggesting that these mycotoxins are also immunotoxic in humans. In animals, immunosuppression does occur in a variety of different species.
* They have been found in human cord blood and sera and apparently can enter the developing fetus in humans and animals.
* Aflatoxins have been found in human breast milk, infant formula, cow‚Äôs milk, and dairy products.
* Aflatoxins are complex organic molecules belonging to the class of mycotoxins. Their chemical structures consist of:

    - Dihydrofurano (or tetrahydrofuran) ring

    - Coumarin-like lactone group

    - Difuran or pentanone group (depending on the type)

    - Methoxy and hydroxyl groups
